The Cutter–Sanborn number (commonly called a Cutter number) is an alphanumeric code, derived from an author’s name stem, used in library cataloging to create unique, shelf-orderable call numbers and to disambiguate similar headings. It is most often applied within classification schemes to order items by author or title within a subject area.
