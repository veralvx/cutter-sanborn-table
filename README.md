This repository provides the Cutter-Sanborn table in three formats: CSV, JSON, TOML.

The Cutter–Sanborn number (commonly called "Cutter number") is an alphanumeric code, derived from an author’s name stem, used in library cataloging to create call numbers. It is most often applied within classification schemes to order items by author or title. It was first created by Charles Ammi Cutter, and later revised by Kate Sanborn and Swanson-Swift.

[`csan`](https://github.com/veralvx/csan) is a CLI tool that generates a Cutter-Sanborn call number.
