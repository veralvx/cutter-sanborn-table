The Cutter–Sanborn number (commonly called "Cutter number") is an alphanumeric code, derived from an author’s name stem, used in library cataloging to create call numbers. It is most often applied within classification schemes to order items by author or title.

[`csan`](https://github.com/veralvx/csan) is a CLI tool that generates a cutter-sanborn identifier, given a first and a last name.
